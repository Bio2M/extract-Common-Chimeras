# Extracting common chimeras

The ExtractCommonChimeras pipeline allows the extraction of chimeras common to several samples according to different selection criteria detailed below.



## Installation

### Requirements

* Perl5 distribution

* CracTools-core perl package. It will be automatically installed by cpanm along with all other CPAN dependancies.

## Documentation

### DESCRIPTION

The extractCommonChimeras pipeline is a tool to extract common chimeras from a list of csv files generated by chimCT. By default, it considers redundant chimeras, i.e. at least in two different samples, but the threshold can be modified.

### USAGE

```

extractCommonChimeras.pl [-h] [-v] [--min-ranking <score>] [--threshold <min_redundancy>] [--min-cover <min_coverage>] [--summary <output_file>] [--output <output_file>] [--Rdata <output_file>] [--filter <filter_file>] <file1.csv> <file2.csv> ... <filen.csv>

Mandatory: at least two csv files (generated by chimera pipeline).

 --output        filename to write the results (default: stdout)
 --min-ranking   minimal rank (score between 0 and 100) to consider the
                 chimera (50 by default)
 --threshold     minimal redundancy to consider a redundant chimera,
                 i.e. the min number of different samples where a same
                 chimera is found (2 by default)
 --summary       make some statistics in the output_file if the argument
                 is defined
 --Rdata         format the statistics for R graphics in the output_file
                 if the argument is defined
 --filter        a file containing chimeras id (one name by line) to be
                 filtered-out (chimeras black list)
 -h --help       output this help and exit
 -v --version    output version information and exit

```

### OPTIONS

```
    -h, --help
    -v, --version
    --min-ranking=I<score>
    --summary=I<output_FILE>
    --threshold=I<min_redundancy>
    --max-cover=I<max_coverage>
    --Rdata=I<output_FILE>
